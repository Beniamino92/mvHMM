mvHMM contains a suite of software based on Bayesian hidden Markov models (HMM) for the analysis of signals from monoamine neurontransmitters, including the following scenarios:

* `/HMM-napupil/` -  modelling pupil and norepinephrine (NA) measurements using a bivariate HMM as detailed in Bang et. al (2023), "_Noradrenaline tracks emotional modulation of attention in human amygdala_", published in Current Biology.
