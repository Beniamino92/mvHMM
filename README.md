# mvHMM

mvHMM contains the stan software (as well as R utilities) to model multivariate measurements of neuromodulators via a Bayesian hidden Markov model (HMM). We provide illustration of our approach for the following scenarios:

* `/HMM-napupil/` -  modelling pupil and norepinephrine (NA) measurements using a bivariate HMM as detailed in Bang et. al (2023), "Noradrenaline tracks emotional modulation of attention in human amygdala", published in Current Biology.
